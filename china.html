         <p><h3>Yangshuo in south China was once a magnet for backpackers because of its cheap prices and laid-back atmosphere, but today it draws all sorts of travelers to enjoy its beautiful scenery and karst mountains. Yangshuo also makes a good base to take a day trip to Guilin for a leisurely trip on the Li River. Many travelers choose to rent bicycles for the trip back, since the route is relatively flat and gives them the opportunity to view farmers toiling in their fields.</h3></p>

         <img src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/best-places-to-visit-in-china/shanghai.jpg?v=1"><br>
         <p><h3>Located on the East China Sea and the mouth of the Yangtze River, Shanghai is the largest city and most developed city in China. Its skyline is filling with skyscrapers while shiny shopping malls, luxurious hotels and prestigious arts centers are rising alongside. The city nights in Shanghai are representative of the Western view of China cities with bright neon signs, bustling streets and numerous businesses. The most popular place to go for a stroll is the Bund, Shanghai’s colonial riverfront along Huangpu River. While levies have significantly changed the Bund’s appearance, a number of architecturally significant buildings are adjacent to the strip and are still visible.</h3></p>

         <p><h3>The Great Wall of China is an assemblage of smaller walls built by various dynasties over many years. Builders erected these walls for protection from invasions by those from the north. The Great Wall itself, with a history lasting over 2000 years, measures approximately 8,800 km (5,500 miles) in length, although some of the sections lie in ruin or have disappeared altogether. It is the longest man-made structure in the world. There are several sections of the Great Wall of China that visitors find interesting. Badaling is the most popular section of the wall. It is close to Beijing and easy to access and climb.</h3></p>
