With a fascinating history that reaches back to the dawn of civilization, Egypt is considered the oldest travel destination on earth. The African nation’s awe-inspiring temples and pyramids have captured the imagination of travelers for thousands of years. Although most people come to Egypt to view its ancient monuments, natural attractions beckon travelers too. The Red Sea coast is known for its coral reefs and beach resorts. A trek through the Sahara can lead visitors to refreshing freshwater spring oasis.

Since the revolution in 2011 and the ongoing counter-revolution, tourists have fled Egypt to a large extent. This has created an opportunity for unique experiences of places in Egypt to visit without the crowds. Finding yourself alone inside a pyramid is now a real possibility.


10. Hurghada Where to Stay

Hurghada is a resort town on the edge of the Red Sea, easily reached via a bumpy six-hour bus ride from Cairo. It offers a more popular alternative to Sharm El Sheikh and Dahab and is now one of Egypt’s most-visited tourist destinations. But that’s understandable, as there’s plenty to love about Hurghada with its many beaches and warm waters.

Once a simple fishing village, this famous resort town has hundreds of high-end hotels along the seafront, yet the focus is still mainly on relaxation. This section of the Red Sea is renowned for its excellent scuba diving opportunities, with gorgeous colorful coral reefs to discover just offshore. Other watersports, like snorkeling, windsurfing, and jet-skiing, are just as popular.

For those who prefer to admire the magical marine life from above the water, there are many places offering glass-bottom boat trips, so you can usually shop around to find the best offer</p>

<h1>2-Alexandria</h1>
<img id="alex" src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/d/best-places-to-visit-in-egypt/alexandria.jpg?v=1"><p><h3>
The second-largest city and leading seaport in Egypt, Alexandria has a prime location on the edge of the Mediterranean. While it has definitely lost some of its former glamor from when it was the capital of Greco-Roman Egypt, this strategically located seaside city still has plenty to offer in terms of culture and history.

Founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, the city was once considered the crossroads of the world. Many of Alexandria’s most famous historic sites, including the Lighthouse of Alexandria and a library that housed more than 500,000 books, were destroyed by devastating earthquakes.

When the Arabs invaded Egypt in 641, they moved the capital to current-day Cairo, and the center of Alexandria was eventually destroyed during the 1882 Bombardment of Alexandria. In the years since, the city has been pieced back together into an over-crowded but vibrant coastal town.<</p>

<h1> 3-Pyramids Of Giza</h1>
<img id="ca" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/08/24/05/21/pyramid-2675466_960_720.jpg">
<p id="ca"><h3>The three pyramids, which house the tombs of ancient pharaohs, are one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. Located on the Giza Plateau, the pyramids are the only Wonder to have remained intact over thousands of years. The Great Pyramid, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, is 138 meters high and is open to tourists via the Robber’s Tunnel. The limestone Sphinx structure is also part of the same complex. The pyramids complex of Giza is the jewel of Egypt tourist attractions and one of the most popular Egypt sightseeing places.</h3></p>
<h1>4-Citadel Of Saladin</h1>
<img id="ad" src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/tr:w-700,h-400/uploads/2018/07/Citadel-of-Saladin-egypt.jpg">
<p><h3>One of the many places in ancient Egypt to be declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the citadel was built by the famous Ayyubid ruler Saladin to protect the Cairo and Fustat (the first Egyptian capital under the Caliphate) against Crusaders. The huge fortification is lined by several watchtowers and houses several stunning mosques and the Well of Joseph inside. The Al-Naseer, Sulayman Pasha and the Al Gawhara Palace museum are three places that are a must for Egypt sightseeing tours in Cairo.</h3></p>

<h2>1-The Egyptian Museum</h2>
<img id="aqaq" src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/EGY/egypt-cairo-egyptian-museum-mummified-monkey.jpg">
<br>
<p><h3>The absolutely staggering collection of antiquities displayed in Cairo's Egyptian Museum makes it one of the world's great museums. You would need a lifetime to see everything on show.

The museum was founded in 1857 by French Egyptologist August Mariette and moved to its current home — in the distinctive powder-pink mansion in Downtown Cairo — in 1897. Yes, the collection is poorly labeled and not well set out due to limits of space (and only a fraction of its total holdings are actually on display). It also suffers currently with some empty cases due to artifacts having been transferred to the GEM, but you still can't help being impressed by the sheer majesty of the exhibits.

If you're pressed for time, make a beeline straight for the Tutankhamun Galleries. The treasures displayed here were all found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, son-in-law and successor of Amenophis IV (later Akhenaten), who died at the age of 18. The tomb, discovered by Howard Carter in the Valley of the Kings in 1922, contained the largest and richest assemblage of grave goods ever found intact in an Egyptian tomb.

Highlights include Tutankhamun's death mask and sarcophagi (Room 3), the pharaoh's lion throne (Room 35), and his fascinating wardrobe collection (Room 9). Afterwards, don't miss a wander through the Egyptian jewelry collection (Room 4), which contains more bling than you'll ever see again in one lifetime, and finish off by viewing the Royal Mummies Collection (Room 56 & 46), where you can say hello to Hatshepsut, Tuthmosis II, Ramses II, and Seti I in person.

Even when the GEM opens, this iconic building will still be used as a museum. It has not been announced which collections will stay here and which will be moved — except for the Tutankhamun Galleries, which will all eventually be transferred to the GEM.

The Egyptian Museum sits right beside Midan Tahrir, the central square of Downtown Cairo. The easiest way to arrive here is to take the Cairo Metro to Sadat station (on Midan Tahrir) and follow the exit signs to the museum.

Location: Midan al-Tahrir, Downtown<</h3></p><br>

<h1>2-Al-Azhar Mosque</h1>
<img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/EGY/egypt-cairo-al-azhar-mosque.jpg">
<p><h3>Al-Azhar Mosque is the finest building of Cairo's Fatimid era and one of the city's earliest surviving mosques, completed in AD 972. It's also one of the world's oldest universities — Caliph El-Aziz bestowed it with the status of university in AD 988 (the other university vying for "oldest" status is in Fes) and today, Al-Azhar University is still the leading theological center of the Islamic world.

The main entrance is the Gate of the Barbers on the northwest side of the building, adjoining the neo-Arab facade built by Abbas II. Leave your shoes at the entrance and walk into the central courtyard. To your right is the El-Taibarsiya Medrese, which has a mihrab (prayer niche) dating from 1309. From the central courtyard, you get the best views of the mosque's five minarets, which cap the building. Across the courtyard is the main prayer hall, spanning a vast 3,000 square meters. The front half is part of the original building, while the rear half was added by Abd el-Rahman.

Al-Azhar Mosque is right in the heart of the Islamic Cairo district and easy to reach by taxi. Al-Azhar Street runs east from Midan Ataba in the downtown area right to the square where the mosque sits.

Address: Al-Azhar Street, Islamic Cairo District</h3></p>

<h1>3-Zamalek</h1><br><img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/EGY/egypt-cairo-the-cairo-tower.jpg"><br><p><h3>The Nile island of Gezira is home to the district of Zamalek and the majority of Cairo's arty boutiques and hipster restaurants. Dating from the mid 19th century, the entire area has a distinctly European feel to its architecture with wide boulevards rimmed by jacaranda trees and splendidly ornate Belle Époque mansions (many of which are now home to various embassies).

Zamalek is Cairo's top dining destination, but the southern tip of Gezira also has a clutch of art galleries to explore. The Palace of Arts is housed in the Nile Grand Hall on the former Gezira Fair Grounds, and features a schedule of rotating exhibitions in its galleries. Nearby is the Museum of Modern Egyptian Art, which has a fine collection of 20th-century Egyptian art including works by Mahmoud Said and Mahmoud Mukhtar.

Much of the southern section of Gezira is taken up by the exclusive tennis courts and riding stables of the Gezira Sports Club, but towering above all the lush greenery is the 187-meter-high Cairo Tower, built in 1961 by President Nasser. A trip up the observation deck at sunset to see dusk settle over the city is a must.</h3></p>
