<h1>1-Burj Khalifa</h1><br>

<p><h3>The Burj Khalifa is one of the United Arab Emirates most famous buildings and the soaring sky-high landmark of Dubai. Not only is it the world's tallest building, it also lays claim to the titles of tallest freestanding structure in the world, highest observation deck in the world, and elevator with the longest travel distance in the world. A trip up to the observation deck, with its panoramic views across Dubai, is a sightseeing highlight for most tourists who visit, though for those who suffer from vertigo, it might be best to give it a miss.

Address: Entry from Dubai Mall, Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai</h3></p>

<h1> 2-Sheikh Zayed Mosque</h1><br>

<p><h3>The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is a mammoth modern mosque of incredible beauty. Harnessing contemporary design and ancient craftsmanship, the mosque harmoniously blends modern and ancient styles and techniques to create a new interpretation of Islamic architecture.

A visit here is a must on any Abu Dhabi itinerary. With its interiors using lavish amounts of gold, mosaic tiles, and glass work and immense amounts of marble, and its exterior of blindingly white stone contrasting dramatically under the Emirati blue sky, it never fails to dazzle.

<p><h3>The newest and most spectacular museum in the United Arab Emirates, the Louvre Abu Dhabi takes visitors on a journey through human history with objects sourced from across the globe and through the ages to demonstrate the links between cultures. Whether you're interested in early history, the great Empirical ages, or modern art, you'll find the museum exhibits fascinating, while the stark and ultra-modern architecture of the building draws visitors in itself.

Address: Saadiyat Island, Abu Dhabi</h3></p>

<br>
<p><h3>The highest peak in the United Arab Emirates, Jebel Jais in the emirate of Ras Al-Khaimah has become much easier to access in recent years thanks to the switchback road that twists and turns all the way up the mountainside.

At the top of the road, a series of landscaped terraces and viewing platforms offer up mountain vistas that roll right down to the sea, while those hankering to pair up their mountain scenery with an adrenaline buzz can opt to throw themselves off the peak on the world's longest zipline, which runs down the side of Jebel Jais for over two kilometers, reaching up to 120 kilometers per hour.</h3></p>
