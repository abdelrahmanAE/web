	<p><h3>A groundbreaking new arts trail sees four leading galleries plus outdoor exhibitions put Yorkshire on the map as a leading sculpture destination. The Henry Moore Institute, The Hepworth Wakefield, Leeds Art Gallery and Yorkshire Sculpture Park are the key attractions of the first Yorkshire Sculpture International, taking place between June 22 and September 29 2019. Nearby, the perfectly preserved Victorian village of Saltaire is well worth a trip. Visitors can find the arts centre and independent shopping centre Salts Mill and the newly opened Salt Beer Factory – an impressive £1.7m brewtap, music venue and food hub launched by local beer heroes Ossett Brewery.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>There’s never a bad time to visit Bristol, and 2019 is no exception. The city’s first shipping container park can be found in the new neighbourhood development Wapping Wharf. Here, some of the city’s best bars and restaurants are found in an idyllic waterside setting; try the seasonal, succinct cooking at Box-E and creative modern beers from Wild Beer Co. While you’re here, stay at Bristol’s coolest new hotel Artist Residence – a boutique chain born in Brighton with a plan to renovate a Grade I-listed former boot factory, opening this autumn.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>While it's possible to plan a trip to the UK without visiting London, it's certainly not to be advised, as the nation's sprawling capital boasts plenty of attractions to keep you busy. For those interested in learning more about the UK's rich history, one of the top things to do in London is visit the Tower of London. Located beside the spectacular Tower Bridge on the banks of the River Thames, this former palace and prison includes highlights such as the iconic 1,000-year-old White Tower, with its fascinating displays of armor and weaponry, and the Jewel House, home to the Crown Jewels.

Fans of Britain's Royal Family will want to head to Buckingham Palace, London's Royal home since Queen Victoria's reign. Here, you can enjoy the colorful pomp of the Changing of the Guard or even take a tour of the Palace's State Rooms (be sure to book in advance as they're only open for a few weeks each year).

The city's Whitehall Road area is another must, where you'll find Big Ben and the Parliament Buildings, as well as Westminster Abbey, scene of many a royal wedding. Another area to visit in London is South Kensington, home to the city's best museums, including the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Natural History Museum, as well as the famous Harrods department store. Also check out Trafalgar Square, home to iconicNelson's Column and the National Portrait Gallery.</h3></p>
